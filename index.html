	<h3>About:</h3>

	<p> I attended University of Calabar from 1981-1985, hold a Bachelor of Laws, LL.B (Hons) degree and thereafter was called to the Bar by the Nigeria Law School, Lagos in 1986.
I later proceeded to London Guildhall University, London, England where I obtained Master of Arts (M.A) in Business Law from 1990 – 1992.<br>
In 2002, I was awarded Admission Certificate, as Solicitor by the Law Society of England and Wales. I proceeded further to Maastricht Graduate School of Governance, Maastricht University, Netherlands, where I am presently serving as a Visiting Lecturer and holds a Ph.D. in Governance with focus on “Governance and Public Policy Analysis”.
I am a visiting Lecturer to the Institution.<br>
I joined the Department For International Development (DFID) of U.K. in 2003 and served for ten years (four as National Programme Manager). Until my appointment as the Director-General of <a href ="http://bpsr.gov.ng" class="yellow">Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR)</a>, I was the National Programme Coordinator for State Partnership for Accountability, Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC).</p>

	<h4><a href="https://goo.gl/78fHEB" download="Abah.jpg" >Abah, J., (2012, Strong Organisations in Weak States, Boekenplan, Maastricht, Netherlands</h4></a>

	<p> It highlights the various
constraints to good public service delivery in developing countries, but
shows that, despite the daunting constraints, some organisations are still
managing to deliver the outputs that they were set up to deliver. It also sets
out the research question that the study seeks to answer, the dependent and
independent variables used, the initial hypotheses advanced, and the
contributions that the research will make to existing literature. </p>

	<h4><a href="img/joe.pdf" download="MOPPS">Managing Organisational Performance in the Public Sector</h4></a>

	<p>Performance Management denotes a range of managerial activities designed to monitor, measure and adjust aspects of individual, programme and organisational performance through management controls of various types.</p>

	<h4><a href="img/Youth.pdf" download="MOPPS">The challenges of youth unemployment in Nigeria</h4></a>

	<p>The need to tackle rising youth unemployment is clear to all. Nigeria needs to develop a coordinated, overarching youth employment policy, approved at the highest level of government, to guide all the interventions.</p>
